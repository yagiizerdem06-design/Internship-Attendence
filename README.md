3D Car Racing Game - Academic Project
This project is a 3D Car Racing game developed as a comprehensive assignment for university courses, spanning from the midterm to the final exams of the semester. It serves as a practical application of game development fundamentals and project management.

Project Overview
The objective was to develop a functional racing system with integrated environment assets. The project emphasizes core mechanics, vehicle physics, and basic AI implementation within a structured development cycle.

Key Features
AI System: Implementation of an AI-controlled vehicle capable of navigating the track and competing against the player.

Environment Design: Integration of 3D assets including roads, buildings, and a functional lighting system to create a realistic racing atmosphere.

Development Cycle: Managed the project from initial prototype (Midterm) to a stable, playable build (Final).

Technical Specifications
Engine: Unity

Programming Language: C#

Focus Areas: Clean code practices, component-based architecture, and efficient project organization.

Objective
The project demonstrates a disciplined approach to fulfilling academic requirements while maintaining professional standards in code structure and documentation. I aim to apply this technical foundation and commitment to a professional internship environment.
